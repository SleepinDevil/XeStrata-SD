// include/strata/image/img_start.hpp - what img2img and a mask share across the image models' pipelines: the
// request's base image, the step its strength starts the sampler at, the mask's latent positions and kept pixels, and
// the device buffers the sampler's start and its steps' blend read.
//
// img2img (a strength below 1) is the flow-matching img2img of diffusers' pipelines: of a schedule's n steps, the
// first floor(n (1 - strength)) are skipped, and the sampler starts at the next one's sigma s from the base image's
// latent on the flow's path, (1 - s) z0 + s noise, the noise being the seed's that a picture from nothing starts
// with: at strength 1 nothing is skipped and the picture is that one.  A mask keeps the base image where it is
// opaque: after each step the latent there goes back to the base's at the step's time, and the picture's kept pixels
// are the base image's own, blended by the mask's alpha (OpenAI's mask: alpha 0 where the image changes).  An edit
// model's base image is its first reference; a model without edits takes the request's init image.
