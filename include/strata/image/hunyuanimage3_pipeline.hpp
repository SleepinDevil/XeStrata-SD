// include/strata/image/hunyuanimage3_pipeline.hpp - HunyuanImage 3.0's text to image on the GPU: the DiT's own
// reading of the prompt's ids, its flow sampling from the seed's noise, and the VAE's image, within a VRAM budget.
//
// The model has no text encoder, so this pipeline takes two files where Qwen-Image's and Mage-Flow's take three:
// the DiT embeds the ids itself (`wte`, with the timestep, the guidance and the meanflow's next timestep written
// over three of those rows), reads them beside the image block through its MoE decoder layers, and the DCAE VAE
// decodes the latent to the picture.  `drop` is 0 (the system turn is part of what the layers read, not a prefix
// they skip), and the guidance is a meta token's value rather than a second pass: Instruct-Distil samples once.
//
// The budget is split per request the way the other pipelines split theirs: the weights that always stay (the
// DiT's dense products, the VAE's) come first, then the sequence's activations, then the experts' banks - a
// resident prefix, the rest streamed from the file's pages through two slots, since 43 GB of quantized bytes is
// no card's memory - and the VAE decodes in what the DiT leaves, its buffers given back first.  The VAE is not
// tiled: its group norms take the whole image, so an image whose decode will not fit is refused by name rather
// than degraded.  What a request leaves on the card (the resident banks, the buffers) stays for the next one.
//
// The pieces around the layers: `wte` and the five embedders still run on the host in FP32, the numbers the CPU
// golden is held to; they cost a step a few hundred milliseconds (a few hundred rows out of a BF16 table, five
// 4096-wide products over one row each).  `patch_embed` and `final_layer` are the card's (HunyuanImage3EntryExit):
// measured on the B70, the host's FP32 convolutions were 30 s of a 33 s step, the layers and the VAE the rest, and
// the card does them in 0.07 s.  `STRATA_HUNYUANIMAGE3_HOST_ENDS=patch|final|both` puts the host FP32 pieces back
// for a check (the card's products take each operand as two FP16 halves, about 2e-6 of the host's: with the
// golden's latent start and 8 steps the B70's picture holds PSNR 35.67 dB, the host's 35.78).
//
// An edit (reference images) is the model's own: each reference stands in the sequence before the prompt as the
// reference's `cond_joint_image` - `<boi> <img_size_N> <img_ratio_i> <timestep> <img> * (its VAE grid)
// <joint_img_sep> <img> * 1024 <eoi>` - whose rows are its VAE latent through `patch_embed` at timestep 0 (the
// VAE's encoder, hunyuanimage3_vae), `timestep_emb(0)`, and SigLIP2's 1024 features through the aligner
// (hunyuanimage3_vision).  The reference is read as the model's processor reads it (hunyuanimage3_refs: the VAE
// copy resized and center-cropped to the bucket the ids name, the ViT copy at its naflex size), its span attends
// to all of itself (hunyuanimage3_positions_of's key limits) and each of its two grids has 2D rope positions of its
// own.  Those rows are the sequence's constant part, computed once a request with the text rows.  The vision
// model's file (`--vision`, the model's bf16 shard with `vision_model.*`) opens the edits; without it a request
// with reference images is refused by name.
//
// A size left to the model (the reference's image_size "auto") is its own choice too: choose_ratio runs the
// sequence up to the generated block's `<boi> <img_size_N>` through the layers as text, and takes the
// `<img_ratio_i>` whose logit is the largest, through the final norm and those 37 rows of the output projection
// (`--ratio-head`, the file setup takes them into out of the bf16 shards) - the reference's img_ratio task, greedy.
// The caller then builds the sequence at that bucket; the rows it shares with the choice's are kept.
